    "There are a lot of discussion boards discussing the process of using, and usefulness of, Jupyter. The opinions of Jupyter seem to vary widely between individual and professional area. Many in the sciences see Jupyter as a useful tool for communicating results (that are reproducible), quickly testing ideas, and one-offs. There seems to be somewhat of a consensus though, that Jupyter is not a development environment.\n",

    "> The main difference between Spyder and the IPython notebook is that the first is meant to develop medium to large programming projects (i.e. something that involves several modules calling one another), while the notebook is meant to write executable documents.  \n",

    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "These ideas may be contrary to what some see Juyter evolving too, and certainly vary by profession. from my view in Scientific Visualization, especially in my specialization (in situ visualization), Jupyter won't work for normal development. The shear number of dependencies that we have to deal with when working in an in situ environment, make the somewhat clunky Jupyter environemnt untenable. However, I do see value in Jupyter, I just feel that it needs to be framed in the context of team communication and collaboration, demonstrating and explaining results to stakehodlers, or interactive data analysis for publications, not as an IDE. Taking that view, Jupyter is a powerful system.\n",
    "\n",
    "My uses for Jupyter may be more limited than those in other areas, and my views may not hold well in areas where highly interactive code runs are commonplace. For me however, I see Jupyter being useful for several things: (1) an easy to access and easy to format document for showing progress reports and documenting interesting occurrences, (2) a reproducible place to house one-off code that has to be written for my or others projects, and (3) documenting important functions in programs, such as those that do analysis or manipulate data from a simulation. The notebooks will allow those functions to be stripped from larger programs and run interactively and sent to stakeholders (who are usually the ones that have the smarts in terms of how to deal with the complex physics in these simulations) for review and verification.
