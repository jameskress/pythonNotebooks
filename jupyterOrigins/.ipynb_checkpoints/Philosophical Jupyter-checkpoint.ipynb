    "This is one of the earliest statements on the design philospohy of the IPythoin Notebook that I could find. In addition to being very telling, it does have implications for multi user interactivity. This to me shows that this notebook system was originally designed to mainly be a single user at a time interface, with collaboration being over repositories etc, without designing in the idea of collaboration. Not to say that cannot add this in, but it was not a driving development factor. "

As such, the interactive computing paradigm should remain central to the user experience and continue to improve over time.\n",

The majority of respondants self-identify as data scientists, students, scientists, and researchers.\n",

    " - Robust text and code editing (like in Emacs, Vim, Sublime, PyCharm)\n",
    " - Advanced code development tools (debugging, profiling, variable watching, code modularization)\n",
